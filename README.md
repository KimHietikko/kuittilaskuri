#kuittilaskuri

This program is for splitting the bill in a groceries store. The program takes PDF-file of the receipt as an input. The PDF-receipt is taken from the S-mobiili application which shows the receipts after the purchase. You can split the bill up to six persons and you can category the products between different categories (such as daily groceries, goods, sport and clothes). The program is written in JavaScript and the code is deployed in Netlify. You can find this program in here: https://kuittilaskuri.netlify.app/
